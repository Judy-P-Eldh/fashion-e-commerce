# E-commerce project in Next.js

A collaborative project where an e-commerce platform was created with the help of Typescript and Next.js, and using the DummyJSON API. The platform presents various products fetched from the API, and allows the user to search for items and browse different item categories. There is also an administrative feature that allows users to manage existing items and create new ones.
